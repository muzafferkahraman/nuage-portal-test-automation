nuage-portal-test-automation

Overview

This repository provides Python-based tools and libraries for automating test cases targeting the Nuage Networks SD-WAN Edge platform. It aims to streamline testing processes, improve reliability, and facilitate continuous integration (CI) pipelines.

Features

    Modular design: Components are organized into well-defined modules for clarity and maintainability.
    Test case framework: Supports the creation, execution, and reporting of test cases.
    Nuage API integration: Functions for interacting with the Nuage API for configuration management and data extraction.
    Logging and reporting: Capabilities for logging test execution details and generating reports.
    Potential use cases:
        Verifying network configurations
        Validating edge device behavior
        Performing performance testing
        Simulating failure scenarios

Requirements

    Python 3.x (recommended: 3.7+)
    Required libraries:
        requests
        pyyaml

Installation

    Clone the repository:
    Bash

    git clone https://github.com/muzafferkahraman/nuage-portal-test-automation.git

Usage

    Configure environment variables like NUAGE_API_URL, NUAGE_USERNAME, and NUAGE_PASSWORD (or other environment-specific details).
    Write test cases using the provided framework or a preferred testing framework (e.g., pytest, unittest).
    Execute tests:
        Manual execution: Run Python scripts directly.
        CI/CD integration: Utilize tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or others.

Examples

Specific code samples demonstrating basic interactions with the Nuage API and test case implementation would be highly valuable additions to the README. Consider including them in separate code blocks or in a dedicated examples folder within the repository.
